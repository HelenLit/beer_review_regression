Little Red Cap,Altbier,Grimm Brothers Brewhouse,Grimm Brothers Brewhouse Little Red Cap,"Notes:Altbier is German for “Old Beer”, this refers to the “old” style of brewing using an ale yeast (As opposed to a lager yeast fermentation which is a relatively new process). This beer originated in the Westphalia region of Germany in a town named Dusseldorf. Due to the cool climate of Dusseldorf, Altbiers employee an ale yeast that has evolved over time to ferment at somewhat cooler temperature than that of other ale yeasts. This cool fermentation produces subtle yeast derived esters and leaves a clean malty beer. In addition to this cool clean fermentation, altbiers are then lagered at cold temperatures to help smooth and refine the beer. The result of this is a very clean and hoppy red ale.Coming in at 6.2% ABV and IBUs Little Red Cap is an easy drinking hop forward beer worthy of its heritage. We use a bit of Cascade hop to give it an “American Twist” while maintaining its German heritage. This beer won a Gold Medal at the 2011 and 2016 GABF and a Bronze at the 2012 GABF. It also won a Silver Award at the 2016 World beer cup.",5.2,25,50,27,39,18,47,52,28,4,24,59,6,100,3.833333,3.833333,3.833333,3.666667,4.0,3

Helldorado,Barleywine - American,Firestone Walker Brewing Co.,Firestone Walker Brewing Co. Helldorado,"Notes:Part of the adventure of aging beer in retired spirits barrels is the synergistic interaction of different malt flavors with the oak and spirit flavors from the barrel. Darker beers like stouts and darker barley wines have typically been the favored candidates for barrel-aging, due to their deeper caramel and roasted flavors. Helldorado breaks that mold with a deep golden color from being brewed solely with English and American pale malts. The bready, honeyed flavors of pale malts pull out rich wildflower honey, vanilla and coconut notes from the oak, creating an overall flavor evocative of bourbon-glazed graham crackers that stands as singularly unique in our Vintage lineup.\t",12.8,60,100,6,39,56,25,101,23,5,45,48,21,134,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,1

Arctic Devil Barley Wine,Barleywine - English,Midnight Sun Brewing Co.,Midnight Sun Brewing Co.

Though the recipe and process for Arctic Devil have evolved over the years, it is brewed once a year then aged in oak barrels for several months before the entire batch is blended, bottled and released.In its youth, Arctic Devil gnarls and snarls its way across the palate. Containing this beast of a beer for long periods in oak barrels--some having previously aged port, wine or whiskey--tames the unleashed malt and fierce hop flavors, melding and mellowing this powerful liquid into an incredible elixir worthy of a brewer's table.Each annual batch of Arctic Devil Barley Wine represents the brewers' resolve to create an intriguing and sought-after barley wine by precisely brewing to well-designed specifications, carefully selecting the type and combination of barrels to use for aging, and meticulously checking the beer as it ages. Distinct nuance and complexity are contributed by the wood's previous tenants, resulting in unique flavor profiles in each batch that continue to change over time.

Devotion,Blonde Ale - Belgian,The Lost Abbey,The Lost Abbey Devotion Ale,"Notes:Belgian Style dry hopped Blonde Ale. It’s an unassuming road leading to the priory. Here, off the corner of two intersecting roads, dedicated monks have been making beer for over 150 years. It’s always been a simple life — the kind that requires they brew only enough to sustain the activities of their monastery. In the silence of passing seasons, they pray, they brew and retire in solitary existence behind the sheltering walls. They live a most interesting life. Most likely one we couldn't sustain.Nearby, each summer, the trellised fields spring to life as rows of resinous green cones are trained toward the heavens. Rumor is some monks love these hops and being surrounded by budding yellow aromas and the leafy pungent fields inspired them. Since we aren't sensible enough to locate our brewery near hop fields, we can only offer this blond ale in celebration of our Abbey brethren and their steadfast Devotion.\t",6.0,15,30,31,33,10,74,45,49,4,72,112,38,63,3.822134,3.970356,3.816206,3.875494,3.964427,253

This was the case in the past, but not anymore... Recently, Hans Peter Drexler, Brewmaster at G. Schneider & Sohn, heard some stories about some extra special Aventinus resulting from some partial freezing during a cold winter transport in the 1930's. He decided to recreate this classic ""mistake"" to further concentrate Aventinus in a modern, controlled facility. Thus, the Aventinus Eisbock was reborn.

Double Ice Bock,Bock - Eisbock,Southampton Publick House,Southampton Publick House Double Ice Bock,"Notes:Southampton Double Ice Bock is based off of a traditional German-style Bock beer. This German lager beer is rich and malty and brewed to an alcohol strength of 6-7%. “Ice Bock” is produced when a Bock beer is partially frozen in order to increase it’s alcohol content. In this process, some of the water content turns to ice, effectively strengthening the flavor and alcohol of the beer. We take this process one step further. After the initial freezing, the beer is decanted off the ice and frozen a second time. The resulting beer is a deceptively smooth and amazingly strong lager.\t",18.0,25,35,15,59,79,15,171,49,0,77,13,10,119,4.022727,3.954545,4.204545,4.181818,4.136364,22
